                <h4> <em> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</em></h4>
                <p>
                    The relationship between mindfulness and selfawareness it that they both help us to 
                    become aware of our current state whether it be physically, mentally or emotionally.
                </p>
                <h4><em> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, 
                    Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</em></h4>
                <p>
                I practised the body scan meditation.</br> I found it surprising about which parts of my body 
                i could bring my attention to and the sensations that I felt. Surprising in the way that these 
                sensations were and always are there, but are 99.95% of the time they were ignored, such as becoming 
                aware of the actue amount of effort used to keep my head up, or the minor tensions in my back muscles from my bad posture. 
                </p>
                <h4><em>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</em></h4>
                <p>
                   I really enjoyed this section. It was like reading something that i had always knew or at 
                   least felt. I like the language change from 'I am' to 'I feel' and agree that this 
                   immediately gives me the opportunity to be content my my current state of emotional 
                   or change it.
