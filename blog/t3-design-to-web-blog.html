            <h4> <em> What is responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</em></h4>
            <p>
                A responisve site will move things on the website that your visiting so that it looks good no matter what size screen your using like a big screen on a computer or a small screen on your phone. 
            </p>
            <h4><em>What is mobile first design, and why it's important?</em></h4>
            <p>
                Mobile first design, means to design your webiste for mobile first and then build your styling to change as the screen gets bigger.<br>
                This is important you need to make sure that your crucial content will fit on a small screen, and its then easier to add more as the screen gets bigger giving you more room to work with.  
            </p>
            <h4><em>What are frameworks, what are the pros and cons when using them?</em></h4>
            <p>
                A framework is a pre-designed structure to build your website upon.<br> 
                The pros are that it makes it alot easier and quicker to build something that will look great.<br>
                The cons are that it can be difficult sometimes to add other elements to the code as you then have to alter the structure.
            </p>
            <h4><em>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</em></h4>
            <p>
                A wireframe is a mock-up of your page layout and design<br> 
                We use them to give you an clear direction of how to build your webiste and were tp place your content.

                    I had some trouble with the nav bar. I was hoping to put in a submenu but io had trouble getting it to align with my text-align:center in my nav and the submenu would pop-hover on the left so i just turned it off. This is a feature i will look at again later. I also want to make a sticky nav with scroll at some stage.<br>
                    Other than that I changed a few design features as I put it together. Partly because i thought it looked better and partly because i dont have the design skills for what i was hoping to do in the header with and title on-top of an image on-top of another image. Also something i may look into again later.
