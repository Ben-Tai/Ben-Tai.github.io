    <h1>Sprint 1 <em>Reflections on Time and Habits</em> </h1>
    <h2>9th December 2017</h2>
    
    <h4> <em> Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</em></h4>
    <p>
      I timed boxed an hour to read the reference material.
    </p>
    <h4><em>What did you find interesting?</em></h4>
    <p>
        I like the idea of the 4 daily questions, the TED talk on making little changes (i also need to loose some weight) and the article on starting things of small.
     </p>
     <h4> <em>What worked for you?</em></h4>
    <p>
        Timeboxing one hour worked well for me. I new how much time i had to work through the material and I also didnt spend time on things that didnt interest me.
    </p>
    <h4><em>Which will you experiment further with?</em> </h4>
    <p>
       I would like to the above mentioned techniques that interested me. Also, does anyone know where I can find a Pomodero Timer? :)
