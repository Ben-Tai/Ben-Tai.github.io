    <h4> <em> What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</em></h4>
    <p>
      Im impressed and alittle surprised at the rate in which DBC grew in its first 2years and too now be in NZ shows that there is quite a high demand for this style of education. But i think that the programme is aptly named a 'bootcamp' for a reason, as it is meant to be a 'transformation' almost, involving alot of hard work and sacrifice. 
    </p>
    <h4><em>What are your impressions?</em></h4>
    <p>
        I'm encouraged that I will be travelling down this journey with similar mined and positioned peers and supportive teachers, and am aware that it will involve alot of hardwork.
     </p>
     <h4> <em>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</em></h4>
    <p>
        I'm a pretty social person and a pretty hardworker so I hope to make lot's of friends and can see myself being kicked out when setting the alarms.  
    </p>
    <h4><em>Have your expectations for EDA changed?</em> </h4>
    <p>
       Not really. 
    </p>
    <h4> <em> Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning enviroment?</em></h4>
        <p> 
            Yes I am excited, and yes I am a little nervous. Deffinitely sharing one of those common fears of DBC beginners.
