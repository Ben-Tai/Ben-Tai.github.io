    <h4> <em> What learnings did you take from the chapter?</em></h4>
    <p>
      I leanrt alot from the first chapter of this book. I learnt the correct definition and the importance of emotional intelligence specifically on how it impacts on someone's hapiness. Its make sense that having a stornger awareness of ones emotional responses can then create a space for 'us' to process and the emotional and then decide on whether to choose positive or negative emotions therefore effecting our happiness. 
      I also found it very interesting the the Basal Ganglia is the physiological processor for intuition and that intuition is experienced with emotion.

    <h4><em>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</em></h4>
    <p>
      It was good. Something that i will practise more often and try and add to my daily routine also.
