                <h4> <em>  What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</em></h4>
                <p>
                    I learn't that a mindful conversation can be pretty tricky, and would deffinietly start with a lighter topic next time I try this with my partner. But i found 'looping' back and forth with her until she was sure that I had understood what she was trying to get across to me and then also 'digging' when I was talking help me to remain in a neutral state. I found it a really effective practise. 
                </p>
                <h4><em> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</em></h4>
                <p>
                I would like to think that I will continue to use all three new techniques. Walking meditation I will continue to use for sure as I quite like walking/hiking. Mindful conversation and mindful listening is something I will deffinitely try to maintain as it make for more meaningful conversations and I think it would help me to really remember or understand what people are saying. I also really like the concept of Joyful Meditation, and bringing that awareness into those joyful moments to really apreciate them and truely expreience them.  
                </p>
                <h4><em>Any other musings?</em></h4>
                <p>
                   I liked that meditation can be trained and effective in most parts of our life whether I am working, talking, eating, or enjoying time with my family.
